        <p>Heyo! My name is Ryan Yip and I am a graduate from the <a href="https://www.ubc.ca">University of British Columbia</a>. I completed my studies under a computer science degree and am currently exploring opportunities to further my education and experience as a programmer. I have decided to work towards creating a website that I can fill with my hobbies and anything that I may find interesting.</p>
