        <p>Heyo! My name is Ryan Yip and I am a graduate from the <a href="https://www.ubc.ca">University of British Columbia</a>. I completed my studies under a computer science degree and am currently exploring opportunities to further my education and experience as a programmer. I have decided to work towards creating a website that I can fill with my anything that I may find interesting. Feel free to look through my source code and/or anything else on my github at <a href="https://www.github.com/RyanYip/">www.github.com/RyanYip</a>.</p>
        <ul>Some of the things that I enjoy:
          <li>Gaming and becoming skilled in games</li>
          <li>Learning new techniques to accomplish things more efficiently or different</li>
          <li>Sports (Running, Soccer, Snowboarding)</li>
          <li>Watching anime and cartoons</li>
