        <p>Hello and welcome to my website dedicated to everything about me, Ryan! I plan to slowly expand this website to act as a profile of sorts for my hobbies and programming work. As an added bonus, I get to have fun learning the ins and outs of linux management and web developement languages like HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP.</p>
        <p>I have setup this website through the use of a <abbr title="Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP">LAMP</abbr> stack and am hosting it on a VPS. I had forgotten how much I liked working with linux and vim. As complicated as it is, there is something satisfying about navigating and executing commands through text that is lost with my daily usage of Windows. I also find I miss the features of vim when I, ableit rarely, use text editors on Windows. I figured this would be a fun project to continuously work on and I can keep adding things as I think of them.</p>
